# Reporting multitemporal analysis by markdown

In order to perform multitemporal analysis datasets in different times can be imported, by:

``` r
im.list()
gr = im.import("greenland")
```

Once the set has been imported we can calculate the difference betwen different dates, as:

``` r
grdif = gr[[1]] - gr[[4]]
```

The output will be something like:
